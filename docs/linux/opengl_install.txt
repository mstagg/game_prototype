1. You can download the latest .tar.gz openGL binaries here: http://glew.sourceforge.net/index.html
2. Extract the tarball
3. In command prompt, run `make all`
4. In command prompt, run `make install`
5. If `error while loading shared libraries: libGLEW.so.2.0: cannot open shared object file: No 
such file or directory` appears, it was likely installed in /usr/lib64 instead of /usr/lib. Run
this command to create a symbolic link: `sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libGLEW.so.2.0 /usr/lib/libGLEW.so.2.0`
6. OpenGL Extension Wrangler should now be installed and ready for use
